  Dear Hiring Manager:
  
  This letter is my application for the full-time Medical Records Clerk position listed on the Indeed.com Job website. My education and experience makes me a strong candidate for this position.
  
  My educational background is an asset to this position. I graduated from Anoka Technical College May 11, 2016, and received my diploma in the Medical Coding Specialist program. I have taken and successfully completed the courses of Medical Terminology, Disease Conditions, Anatomy and Physiology, that will benefit greatly to the Medical Records Clerk position. My experience in healthcare includes a hands-on internship that was completed at Fairview Southdale Hospital from January 2016 to May 2016. I am a member AHIMA and preparing for my CCA exam.
  
  For the past several years, I have worked in manufacturing as a Lead which has taught me leadership skills, and that has given me excellent verbal and written communication skills. Through my manufacturing experience I had to be highly detailed orientated and organized; I demonstrated time management skills and the ability to multi-task in a fast paced work environment to meet goals and deadlines. I have also gained the skills and ability to identify and resolve problems, and I am flexible; able to take direction.
  
  I look forward to interviewing with you and hope you believe I am the person for the position. My résumé accompanies this letter. I can be reached either via email at adegalindez@my.anokatech.edu or by phone at 763-370-7071. Thank you for your consideration.
  
  
  Sincerely,
