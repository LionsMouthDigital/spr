  Dear Recipient:
  My interest in administration and or clerical work has taken me from working various careers, such as, the U.S. Army and an office assistant at a doctorâ€™s office a few years ago. I have a total of approximately three years of clerical work. I am a quick learner and willing to learn as much needed and more. In my previous career with the U.S. Army, I was able to showcase my administration abilities as an Orderly Room Clerk such as answering the telephone, pulling personal records of soldiers in my unit, greeted higher ranking officials, schedule meetings for my Commander, process different types of paperwork, and work in a face past environment. I have experience in filing medical records, pulling medical records, and reorganizing misfiled charts. I held a top-secret security in the U.S. Army as a Signals Intelligence Analyst.  I have always displayed my careful approach in any opportunity I have been granted. Everything I have engaged in so far has been driven by my keen interest in administration/ clerical work and customer service skills. I will be moving to Minnesota the end of August to pursue a business administration degree.  
  I look forward to contributing my skills and experiences to the Medical Records Clerk position and hope to have the opportunity to speak with you further about how I can be an asset to your team. 
  
  Sincerely,
  Shayna Stofferahn
