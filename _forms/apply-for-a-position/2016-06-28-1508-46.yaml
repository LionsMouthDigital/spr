  Dear Hiring Manager, 
  
  I am writing you regarding the position of Medical Records Clerk.
  
  	I posses many of the posted skills and qualities you are looking for. I have strong interpersonal communication skills, have a vast amount of computer skills and very strong organizational skills. I am very eager to learn about radiology. I take pride in a job well done and done right the first time. 
  
  	I worked for a construction company previously as a dispatcher and was tasked with various data entry projects so I have experience on the phone as well as imputing information into spreadsheets and other programs. 
  
  	Currently I am a student at Century College working on a degree in radiology. I feel that I would be a great fit for the Medical Records Clerk. My school schedule is evenings so I am available to commit to the hours needed for this position. 
  
  Please take a moment to look over my resume that I have attached for your review,
