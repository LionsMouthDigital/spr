  Dear Hiring Manager, 
  
  I am writing to express my interest in the Medical Records Clerk position currently posted on minnesotajobs.com. While looking through the company mission I noticed Saint Paul Radiology is fully dedicated to provide quality and service that exceeds the expectation of the customers time after time. It is dedicated to the safe and efficient use of technology to improve the health of our patients. It is also supporting our community with free disease screenings, healthcare student mentoring and local youth educational and arts initiatives. This encouraged me to apply for this position as I want to work for a company that shares the same values as me. Based on my professional experiences and education, I know I will be an excellent fit for your organization.
  
  This position stood out to me because it is an opportunity for me to apply my 4+ years of customer service experience and direct patient facing experience as well as my education and trainings. I worked in a dental hospital as a dental surgeon in Nepal for 2+ years where I was directly dealing with varieties of patients with diverse population. While working as a dental surgeon I learned to have an attitude of patience, listening ability and to respond them back in a polite manner. I also worked as a customer service representative at a pharmacy for 2+ years where I learned to have an organized workspace, and respect towards all customers. I recently completed a Medical Office Training course at Goodwill Easter Seals which included medical terminology, patient registration, appointment scheduling, procedure posting, payment posting, Insurance, and HIPAA guidelines. In addition to this, I recently completed Computer Literacy Level 2 course at Goodwill Easter Seals which included Microsoft Office Word, Excel, Outlook, Email, Internet, Cloud computing and calendar. My previous experience of dealing with patients and my customer service experience, combined with my recent education would make me an excellent fit for this position.
  
  I am genuinely interested in working for Saint Paul Radiology and believe myself as a perfect fit for this role. If you would like to reach me, I can be contacted via phone at 651-529-5005 or by email: mustaphamansuri2016@gmail.com. I am looking forward to speak with you regarding this position. Thank you very much for taking the time to consider my potential contributions and impact as a Medical Records Clerk. 
  
  Sincerely,
  Mustapha Mansuri
