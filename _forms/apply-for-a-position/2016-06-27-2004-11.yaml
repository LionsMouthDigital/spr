  Hi,
  
  My name is Elizabeth Vang. I am writing to you because I am interested in the Clerk position. I have customer service experience at Dairy Queen and Home Depot. I have some experience filing and sorting as it was part of my duties as a Pre-K teacher because I was required to file and organizing documents. I feel that my job experience has given me to skills for this Clerk position at St. Paul Radiology.   I hope you will consider me for this position. Thank you for your time.
  
  Sincerely,
  
  Elizabeth Vang
