  It is with interest and enthusiasm that I am responding to the Medical Records Clerk job posting from Indeed.com. I believe that this is an excellent opportunity for me to utilize my current skills as well as learn new ones.
  
  I graduated from Saint Paul College In May 2016 and I am proud to have my associate’s degree in Health Information Technology. I do not have experience outside of school with handling medical records but I would like the chance to be proficient in that area. I have provided superior customer service for over 15 years and I would like to continue to do so with St. Paul Radiology.
  
  I would very much like to be part of your team and to make a meaningful contribution.  My resume has been enclosed for review. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your consideration.
