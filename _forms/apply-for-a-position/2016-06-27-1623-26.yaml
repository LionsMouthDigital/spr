  Dear Hiring Manager,
  
  The advertisement mentioned that you are looking for someone who can handle customers who can sometimes be upset, is a high school graduate and can work in an office setting. 
  
  I feel my qualifications and your requirements are a great match, and I have the skills needed to help St. Paul Radiology  grow as an organization. I possess 4 years of customer service experience and enjoy working in an office setting.
  
  In my current career I work as a Call center representative and I have learned to perfect my customer service skills. At my first position I was depended on to talk to our customers about technical support and issues with their computers, controlling our waiting list and selling computers to our customers.  At United Hospital where I volunteered I learned data entry as well as auditing and patient discharge. I have knowledge of patient confidentiality (HIPAA) and I am proficient in safety precautions.
  
  Please view my resume where you will find more of my qualifications.
  
  Thank you for your time and consideration.
  
  Sincerely,
  
  Keshia Finney
