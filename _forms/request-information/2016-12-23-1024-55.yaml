  I’m looking for a price quote on an MRI that my doctor ordered for a 6cm lipoma on my right shoulder.  The code he ordered is 73221.  My insurance is Preferred One - group #PCH42954  /  ID #80215136600.   Please also let me know if your quote includes the MRI reading.
  My doctor is at Hudson Physicians in Hudson, WI and I had an appointment setup for an MRI at the Hudson Hospital on 12/27 but I’m finding their pricing is extremely high compared to others in the area.  Therefore, I have cancelled that appointment and would like to get one set up with another facility as soon as possible.  Your downtown St. Paul facility is the location I would prefer going to.
