  I hope as a patient I may ask a question.  I routinely dissect reports so I understand them but I have been unable to find an absolute meaning when I see, "There is fatty change in some of the vertebral bodies" (this is  pertaining to a Cervical MRI).  
  
  Your help in interpreting this is appreciated.
