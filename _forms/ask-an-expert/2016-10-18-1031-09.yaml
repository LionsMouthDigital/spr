  We are two biomedical engineering graduate students at the University of Minnesota conducting research for a project related to the placement of PICC's, CVC's, and other catheters. We are specifically looking into complications (such as thrombosis) caused by the tip migration of central lines. We are wondering if one of your clinicians would be willing to speak with us briefly over the phone about experiences with CVC's PICC's, etc. 
  
  Thanks!
