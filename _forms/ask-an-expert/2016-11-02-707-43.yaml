  printing-in-china.com By Cary Sherburne, Senior Editor October 28, 2004 -- With all on the vendor hype around JDF and Computer Integrated Manufacturing, I desired to determine what it absolutely was that printers visiting Graph Expo were really in search of. Are they seeking JDF-enabled solutions? Do they can care about it latest in a very string of three-letter acronyms? Are they seriously considering implementing CIM within their companies? With that under consideration, I accosted a couple of unsuspecting victims about the show floor have been kind enough to express their thoughts together with the readers of WhatTheyThink. Mark Weiss, CRW Graphics, Pennsauken NJ Weiss began our conversation by saying, &ldquo;In the spirit of full disclosure, it is best to be aware that while I do manage a printing business, I am extremely involved together with the standards bodies. I am the co-chair from the advertising workgroup for CIP4.&rdquo; Weiss comments that currently, the only real real communication JDF-wise as part of his plant is between his Creo prepress systems-Brisque and Lotems for CTP&mdash;and his awesome Heidelberg presses, where he's transmitting color information from prepress in the press room. He currently is utilizing MBO to include a JDF-compliant Navigator folder for the JDF-enabled workflow mix. He says, &ldquo;Everything we buy has to get JDF compliant or involve some plan to acquire there. CIM must be section of your purchasing plans even should you don&rsquo;t want to implement it without delay. With equipment life of five to eight years or higher, I don't desire to find yourself with obsolete equipment that is certainly two, three to four years.&rdquo; He also stated how the real glue that holds a CIM implementation together is MIS, and hubby continues to be anticipating his MIS treatment for get up to date. When I asked whether his operation could well be JDF-compliant end to finish by next drupa, he replied, &ldquo;I don't be aware that I am usually 100% JDF end to separate before next drupa because I probably can't get enough capital equipment and procedures changed and furthermore, as we execute a great deal of customized work. But within couple of years, I expect 85% in the work to become JDF end to get rid of. What benefits does he see from implementing JDF compliant solutions? Weiss said, &ldquo;I check out JDF being a great tool to release my folks so that they is usually looking with the things which are likely to impact the coffee quality and creativity of whatever we are producing. Today I have talented people that happen to be hanging out making folding dummies of 16-page layouts that we've got created a large number of times. With JDF, they don't really should make it happen. I can decide the best template and understand it work Once I adapt JDF workflows, I know I am sending consistent instructions to my equipment plus it won't contain the variability of any human operator&mdash;equipment doesn't employ a bad day; it either does the project or it doesn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;On the Internet side of the business we have already been with this automation benefit several years, and that we have automated the full prepress process there. If we discover a challenge with your process, the best way you can remedy it is usually to rewind and reprogram laptop so how the automation is smarter. In first, 20% in the files we received required human intervention. We are as a result of one half one percent. The computer is tireless; it may search by using a numerous different combinations of things to discover the appropriate answer. When we all do find an issue, it normally takes me weeks to program it, nevertheless the the very next time that mix of variables hits me, this system will determine what to try and do. I am looking to doing the identical form of thing with JDF for the printing side on the house.&rdquo; What is his advice as for the best approach to stay current by what is occurring with all the standards? He says, &ldquo;Talk in your counterparts. Learn about JDF and CIM as the capital needs plus your plant evolves, and step-by-step, think about how exactly it is possible to implement it. Because while it needs an upfront investment today, the payoff when it comes to quality, process improvement as well as the longevity of your respective equipment in enabling one to compete economically causes it to become a viable investment strategy. Send someone through your operation throughout the IPA&rsquo;s JDF certification program. It is delivered inexpensively through Web and definately will provide you through an in-house expert that will add significant value inside planning and implementation process.&rdquo; Ron Davis, SchedulingForPrinters.com While not operating a printing business today, Ron Davis is really a printer all his life. Seeing a requirement for just a scheduling solution that mimics the best way printers schedule work today, he's got spent a final four years making a Web-based hosted answer to do exactly that. Davis was visiting Graph Expo as portion of his ongoing efforts to hold abreast from the latest industry developments. Relative to JDF adoption, according to him, &ldquo; It is likely to happen within the next decade. But printers could care less about JDF; the things they want include the results that JDF may bring them. They want to view the pros in dollars&mdash;what they have to spend versus what they will save and what efficiencies they will make do implementing a remedy. They certainly don&rsquo;t care around the 800 pages of standards connected with JDF. In the globe of pcs, we select print plus it prints to your printer we have now set up. In the fabrication environment, we want to have on the same place. JDF has to be transparent so which the printer doesn't ought to manage terminology, he just plugs and plays. The companies are behind; this is a slow and hard road, but I believe we are going to make it.&rdquo; He concluded by saying, &ldquo;The progressive, efficient printers will invariably achieve success. If you won't stay efficient and informed, you will likely be added to your 20% of print enterprises that went outside of business on the previous couple of years.&rdquo; Arthur Kwiatkowski, Gilchrist, Toronto Arthur Kwiatkowski, the Senior Bureau Operative for Gilchrist away from Toronto, graduated that has a degree in Graphic Communications Management from Ryerson not too long ago. He says, &ldquo;A lot in the courses at Ryerson were built with a st ron g consentrate on JDF, as well as the professors were always considering new technology, and showing everyone the actual way it will help and ways in which we&mdash;being a new generation coming to the industry&mdash;can customize the printing industry. Working at the global company, with offices in Canada and also the UK , I observe that JDF can streamline much of the issues we're able to faced down the highway with automation. When were sleeping in Canada , they in Leeds is working, and the other way round. So automation can speed things up and create better efficiencies by causing it easier at hand off processes to and fro.&rdquo; Kwiatkowski worked part-time at the Gilchrist subsidiary throughout the four years he was finishing his education and was able to acquire in for the ground floor of any new development venture that started inside the To ron to branch two a long time ago. The venture uses an internally developed MIS solution, DALiM TWiST and RealTimeProof in a integrated solution. According to Kwiatkowski, &ldquo;DALiM and RealTime are JDF compliant; our second step is always to build JDF compliance in the MIS solution&rdquo;. He adds, &ldquo;I think it can be still going for taking a number of years for JDF to be pervasive, as existing non-compliant investments will be replaced. It will still take several years, but we're also definitely relocating the correct direction.&rdquo; In addition to his just work at Gilchrist, Kwiatkowski is in search of other methods to spread the saying. He says, &ldquo; I think greater that younger people get included in new technology, a lot more a will alter. The more could, as well as the harder we work to push the technology to its limits, the higher quality off the is going to be in the longer term. You have to find out new stuff every single day, and simply then could we advance JDF and also other improvements to work processes. To help that learning process, someone and I are from the strategy of publishing a forum to encourage more JDF collaboration and learning. Called JDFPlanet.com, it will probably be an interactive chat environment using the newest Web collaboration techniques.&rdquo; Robert and Tim Mahaffey, Mahaffeys&rsquo; Quality Printing, Jackson MS A father and son team, Robert and Tim Mahaffey chance a successful printing business in Jackson MS. Robert is within the printing business since 1951. He says, &ldquo;I begun when I was 18. I actually got a new printing plant in my honeymoon, and trust it or otherwise, I am still married for the same woman.&rdquo; The Mahaffeys located Graph Expo to appear at digital presses so they might add variable data on their blend of offerings. They got such a Heidelberg Quickmaster DI in 1996 to try and do short-run printing, augmenting the long-run work produced using their 6- and 8-color Heidelberg presses. Today, family members is seeing runs get even shorter plus a real possibility to add variable data. Mahaffey Sr. says, &ldquo;We have considered a number of the JDF developments, so we do not think it's ready. I&rsquo;ve been planning to drupa for forty years, and in all honesty, I am not serious about JDF. I already possess a good handle on my own manufacturing process.&rdquo; Mahaffey Jr., a graduate of RIT, pipes in, &ldquo;Dad feels the complete information mill likely to turn to digital above the next several years. He has always looked out in to the future and kept track of technology. And we've got always had cash to obtain new equipment.&rdquo; Mahaffey Sr. adds, &ldquo;We execute a lots of quick turn work. Our people are spoiled. We might take a career via PDF at a town 150 miles away and also have it delivered in their mind another day. That&rsquo;s why I am not thinking about JDF today.&rdquo; ,<a href="http://printing-in-china.com/label-printing/">self adhesive labels</a> <a href="http://printing-in-china.com/office-supplies/">medical office supplies</a>
