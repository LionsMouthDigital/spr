  by Noel Ward, Editor@Large October 29, 2002 -- AS I WAS HEADED FOR THE PRESS ROOM to write down this up I ran directly into Gilles Biscos of Interquest who asked what I thought from the show. You were somewhat negative about it the very last time we spoke, said Gilles. This question may be floating around quite a little this first day from the 23rd Xplor Conference. While real numbers are tough to come by at this point, a go through the floor traffic shows what can best be described as moderate. But this really is not just a bad thing. Predictions of sparse attendance at this show are already rampant, but as on this moment, 4:36 Pacific Time, I'd have to say it doesn't appear too bad. I'll get a better read about the quality with the attendees on the next couple days. Vendors just like a crowd, however they like decision-makers and buyers of their booths even better. And if fewer folks are coming but are what exactly are termed higher quality, then this vendors is going to be happy and that is certainly good for your future on this show. Oc&eacute; Printing Systems USA began the show before the doors opened this morning with a press conference that crowded the business's booth as press and analysts paid attention to Carl Joachim and Guy Broadhurst describe the highlights and broad capabilities in the new VarioPrint and VarioStream categories of print engines. The new engines are an important advance for Oc&eacute;, and therefore are replete with features and capabilities that address a broad range of cut sheet and continuous form printing requirements inside transactional and publishing markets. As noted previously on WTT, VARIO means Variable Input and Output of both datastreams and substrates. The VarioStream 7000 series extends our postion as the leader inside high-speed, roll-fed printer placements inside U.S., noted Joachim, Vice President of Marketing. It continues our tradition of putting our customers first by delivering the quickest, most efficient and innovative solutions within the industry. The roll-fed VarioStream is scalable from 191 to almost 1,300 images each and every minute, and can print with MICR toner at 1060 images each minute, soon to be increased to almost 1,300. According for an independent study by IDC, Oc&eacute; solutions provide you with the highest monthly capacities and lowest total cost of ownership in production printing. While those numbers are impressive, it can be cut-sheet printing that accounts for a few 85% with the U.S. digital production printing market. Extending Oc&eacute;'s reach into that market is the job with the new VarioPrint series, the VarioPrint 5115 and 5160, with models to follow. Both will be offering MICR and highlight color capabilities. The new lines will discover early customer engagement late in the first quarter of 2003 and will probably be generally for sale in June 2003. What all these new machines offer is often a huge selection of choices that customers can configure according to their requirements. There are over 20 models inside the VarioStream family, notes Broadhurst, Director of Product Marketing. Each may be customized in terms of processors, memory, consumables, image quality and speed to satisfy many requirements--and adapt as new opportunities emerge. All models inside the Vario lines support UP3I, the Universal Printer Pre- and Post-Processing Interface for communication with finishing and binding equipment. On the heels of Oc&eacute;'s announcements, IBM announced the development of the company's Infoprint 4100 family with two new models, the Infoprint 4100 HS2 and Infoprint 4100 HD3/HD4. The new additions enable the IP4100 to print 6x9 pages at speeds up to 2,238 impressions for each minute (3-up with a 19-inch-wide web), and even at 1,220 ipm for letter-size pages. Like the brand new Oc&eacute; devices, the newest IBM Infoprint models support UP3I. Both machines will likely be available beginning November 22, 2002. IBM also announced Version 3 of the toner due to the printers, said to raise paper quality of solid fill areas, bar codes, grayscales, lines and graphics. The new toner also improves fusing and adhesion to paper, a crucial benefit for customers who use post-processing equipment and require effectiveness against rub-off and smear. Big Blue also announced XML Extender for producing AFP from XML documents. AFP is used by a lot of production and distributed printing apps, and XML is used to support initiatives in business process integration, content management and Web services applications, among others. It is sensible for IBM to supply a way for AFP and XML to be effective together. Finally, IBM and Pitney Bowes are demonstrating a combined offering with their respective Infoprint and DFWorks workflows. This Automated Document Factory (ADF) solution show end-to-end charge of output coming from a single point of control. Lots of things to view over inside Xerox booth, but few new announcements. A lot in the examples were things shown earlier this year at GraphExpo. The DocuColor 6060 took center stage for color, with various monochrome machines revealing a selection of apps and output. The roll-fed DocuPrint CF 700 may be tweaked in many ways and was producing much higher quality prints than the very last time I watched it last year. A great unit on dislpay was the DocuPrint 75/90 combined with all the ASF100-D inline booklet making system. Running DocuSP and DigiPath this combo produces saddle-stitched booklets with variable data from a footprint around three feet wide and perhaps 14-feet long. It are prepared for IPDS and LCDS datastreams in addition to PostScript, PCL and PDF. Xerox also had its Invisible Control Marks solution running on a DocuTech 180 MX. This is Xerox's version from the InvisiVision invisible ink solution running at the amount of vendors. There are some differences in the solutions and I'll make an effort to report back on these afterwards. Invisible marking is often a real advantage for adding codes and control marks to pages to maintain data secure plus particular, support data-to-mail integrity without peppering pages with visible control numbers that will detract through the appearance of an document. Some with the solutions I'll have a look at have reached Oc&eacute;, Gunther, Bell &amp; Howell, and Pitney Bowes, and I suspect you will find others. Tomorrow we'll take a take a look at some software from Exstream, Elixir, Metavente yet others, along with the machines of Gunther, Scitex Digital Printing yet others. ,<a href="http://printing-in-china.com/office-supplies/">reliable office supplies online</a> <a href="http://printing-in-china.net/">printing services</a> <a href="http://printing-in-china.net/office-supplies.html">Office Supplies</a>  By WhatTheyThink Staff Published: May 4, 2004 ,<a href="http://printing-in-china.com">Printing Services</a> <a href="http://printing-in-china.com/paper-gift-printing/">wrapping paper</a> <a href="http://printing-in-china.com/office-supplies/">business office supplies</a>
