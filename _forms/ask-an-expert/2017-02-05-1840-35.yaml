  Hi everyone!, maybe I am posting it at a wrong place, I just see that members have alive discussion at this place. 
  I am looking for someone with an experience of MAKING CASH with an AFFILIATE STORE? I made some cash with GOOGLE ADSENSE before but not much. My friend has suggested to purchase a wordpress blog website for sale ebay at 999webdesign.com (here is URL if you are lazy to type it, http://999webdesign.com/ - direct link - "MULTIPLE REVENUE STREAMS WEBSITES") - I hope it can work! It looks like they are making good MONEY MAKING SITES. Don't you mind share your opinion and experience? I was not able to find a good looking 
  FREE AFFILIATE WEBSITE and 999webdesign.com sounds reliable. Many thanks!
