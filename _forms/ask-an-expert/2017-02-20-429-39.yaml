  Hey gang, maybe I am posting it at a wrong place, I just notice that members have alive discussion at this thread. 
  I am looking for someone with an experience of MAKING CASH with an AFFILIATE STORE? I made some cash with 999Webdesign.com and ITUNES before but not much. My friend has suggested to contact a ebay web templates at flipper.top (here is URL if you are lazy to type it, http://flipper.top/ - direct link - "MULTIPLE REVENUE STREAMS WEBSITES") - I hope it can work! It looks like they are making good MONEY MAKING SITES. please share your opinion and experience? I was not able to find a good looking 
  FREE AFFILIATE WEBSITE and flipper.top sounds affordable. See ya!
