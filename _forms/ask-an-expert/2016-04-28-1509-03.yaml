message: 'I had a mammogram and it came back that they saw some tissue on my right breast and would like to do a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound.  I would like to have this done near my work.  I just have a high deductible that will cover this.  The codes are G0206/G0279 and 76642 for cost out.  I was wondering if you do this and the cost.  Thank you.  I can provide my last mammogram.'
