  Elon Musk, it seems, <a href=http://fun2news.com/en/news/228-the-world-is-falling-apart-what-russia-should-expect-after-the-crisis?limit=1&start=1>Environmental and climatic catastrophes that will change the world</a> loves nothing more than to spin plates. When most of us might be looking to lighten the load, he's piling on the ambition. 
  The serial entrepreneur's latest gambit is to fly people around the Moon. Two wealthy individuals have apparently lodged significant deposits with his SpaceX company to make this journey. 
  We have no idea who they are, just that these space tourists <a href=http://fun2news.com/en/news/211-marasmatic-photos-that-will-do>The best works of the photo contest Hasselblad Masters Awards 2016</a> include "nobody from Hollywood". 
  That Mr Musk should announce his intention to carry out a Moon loop should not really be a surprise; such a venture is on the natural path to deep-space exploration and colonisation - his stated end goals. 
  What does take the breath away is the timeline. 
  He's talking about doing this journey in late 2018, in hardware that has not yet even flown. That's Elon for you.
