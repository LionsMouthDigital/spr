  Antibiotic resistant bacteria are bacteria that cannot be fully inhibited or killed by an antibiotic. The antibiotic may have worked effectively before the resistance occurred, <a href=http://www.trumpetmaster.com/vb/groups/trump-m/buy-antibiotics-no-prescription-overnight-1253.html>pharmacy online buy antibiotic usa</a>. However, bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics by adapting their structure or function in some way that prevents them from being killed by the antibiotic. This mechanism might happen in several ways: 
   
  - bacteria can neutralize the antibiotic before it has an effect 
  - bacteria may be able to pump the antibiotic out 
  - bacteria may be able to change the site (receptor) where the antibiotic normally works 
  - bacteria can mutate and transfer genetic material that codes for resistance to other bacteria 
  The resistant bacteria that survive the effect of the antibiotic are able to multiply, spread to others and cause further infections in the family, community, and/or health care setting. In turn, these infections are more resistant to another round of the same antibiotic.
