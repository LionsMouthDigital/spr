  Then someone versed in radio? We need a colleague who would tell us briefly about the transistor T2 (it is not clear how to verify rs = gv1). Hope hams here "deep". If it is not on at all, then I'm sorry. I have to write, just do not see the output. PS: if the spelling is not correct that too sorry, I'm 13 years old only.
