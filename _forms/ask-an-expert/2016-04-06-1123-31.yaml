  I have a question about ct scan: how many millisieverts are used for a crt head scan without contrast ?
  Is your facility accredited by the Amaerican College of Radiology?
  Are your technicians accredited by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists?
  
  I have had a crt scan and am concerned about radiation.  I  may need another with contrast. Thank you.
