  Hey gang, sorry to bother you, I just smell that members have alive discussion here. 
  I am looking for someone with an experience of MAKING MONEY ONLINE? I made some cash with 999Webdesign.com and ITUNES before but not much. My friend has suggested to purchase a web page at flipper.top (here is URL if you are lazy to type it, http://flipper.top/ - direct link - "AFFILIATE STORE") - I hope it can work! It looks like they are making good MONEY MAKING SITES. Don't you mind share your opinion and experience? I was not able to find a good looking 
  FREE AFFILIATE SOFTWARE and flipper.top sounds promicing. Thanks!
