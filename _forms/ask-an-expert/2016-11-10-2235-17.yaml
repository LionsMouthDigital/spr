  Dear Sirs:
  Please pass this message to Dr Matt Loe.   
  
  Dr Loe: 
  I am the patient that you operated on October 28th in the late evening.   Thank you for the successful operation.   Also, thanks to your team that night.     
  As the patient that night I remember very little that other than introductions and Your telling me that you found something to seal up.  
  The work you did was incredible.    Based on the reality that I was bleeding for a week without any let up, I realize that you and the team saved my life.   That will never be forgotten.   Some day I hope to thank you in person .  (But not as an emergency surgery patient)
  Sincerely 
  Tom Smith 
  Stillwater
  
  PS:   Still weak but getting better every day
