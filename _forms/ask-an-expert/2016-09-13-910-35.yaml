  Hello!  I used to come there in Eagan for Mammograms, and switched to CDI in WSP a few years back because they could do ultrasounds if needed instead of having to go out to Maplewood for them which was required from your office back then .  But do you now do breast ultrasounds there in Eagan?  It would be so convenient to know.
  
  Also, if needed, is 3D Mammograms done there as well in Eagan?
  
  Thank you,
  Ruth
