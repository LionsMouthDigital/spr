  FREE: Economic Roundup, Printing's Strong August, Keys to Print Business Success? <a href="http://printing-in-china.net/">printing solutions</a> <a href="http://printing-in-china.net/Book-Printing.html">Book Printing</a> Kornit Digital lives in Israel and announced in the show how they have their own first Kornit Avalanche Hexadirect-to-garment printer install inside U.S. Kornit recently introduced its Avalanche Hexa, a six-color-plus-white 23.5 x 35-inch textile printer. It prints on cotton, polyester, cotton-polyester blends, Lycra, viscose (aka rayon), linen, leather, denim, silk, wool, and even more. The Avalanche Hexa prints using Kornit&rsquo;s aqueous pigment-based NeoPigment inks, with throughput within the selection of as much as 250 shirts hourly (for light garments) and as much as 140 hourly for darker garments. The NeoPigment inks provide a wide gamut of bright colors, durability, and chance to withstand fading from washing. They print using a range of fabrics which tend not to require offline pretreatment. As with the installation, Top Promotions, a producer of promotional items, will be the first U.S. customer for that Avalanche Hexa. The Alexandra Hexa sits alongside this company&rsquo;s also recently introduced Avalanche 1000 mass production garment printer. (It is usually worth indicating that Kornit was handing out pastel sunglasses that were a serious hit, especially using the WhatTheyThink staff. Alas, they didn&rsquo;t have my prescription.) ,Refining Packaging Cycle Time: The 鈥淟ast Mile鈥?Power of Digital
