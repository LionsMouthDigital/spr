message: 'My doctor in River Falls, WI, will be ordering for me an MRI of the prostate.  The reason for such is an elevated PSA reading.  I wish to know what all is entailed at St. Paul Radiology for such a procedure.  1) Is the procedure invasive at all, as through the insertion of any device?  2) Does the procedure involve the injection of a dye into my system?  3) Is there anything I need to do prior to the MRI in terms of preparation?  And 4) How long does the procedure last?  Thank you for your feedback on this matter.  I look forward to hearing from you.'
