  I was called from the office and asked if I would "help out" & change my 1pm appt to 4, no problem was my response.  I didn't get into xray till well after 5.  The order was called in by Entire staff the day before & you would expect that if paperwork was needed someone would have asked for it well before I sat waiting for 1.5 hours. 
   Your tech had the worst breath, I was almost sick.  She didn't know what she was doing & kept consulting with a co-worker in another area.  She couldn't even load the film. I was in pain from a rib injury, the Tech was not taking that into consideration when obtaining the xray.
  Never again, I will request my Dr and the clinic use CDI from now on.
