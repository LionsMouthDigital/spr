comments: 'For some reason there was a scheduling mix up, SPR had me scheduled for the 16th which we had changed to the 18th. When I arrived on the 18th for my 12:00pm appointment there was no openings,  receptionist and Peggy -Radiologist managed to get me in at 3:00pm which I greatly appreciated in that I live 1 hour North of St. Paul..  Both Receptionist and Peggy were very professional and courteous, their wiliness to adjust and fit me in saved me another trip.'
