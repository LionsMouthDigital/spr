  My MRI appointment on 3.10.17 was scheduled for 4.45PM, I was asked to be there for 4.30PM. I arrived there at 4.20 PM and was informed that MRI is running a bit behind.  At 5.15 PM I went to the front desk and asked when would I be called and was informed again they are running behind - 20-30 mins more.  At 5.30 PM somebody came to let me know it would be another 20-30 mins more as they were having a medical emergency.  At 6.00PM I went up to the front desk and let them know I would be going to Marshall's to pick up a few items and left my cell-phone number.  They called me at 6.15 PM to let me know they were ready for me and  I walked out of the building 3 H later at 6.44 PM.
  
  The MRI technician was very professional and apologized profusely, informing me that there had been a medical emergency and she was tied up with the patient as she could not leave his side until the paramedics arrived.  
  
  I am a physician, working in a clinic and totally understand medical emergencies can happen anytime. I still think though that there should be a better back-up plan to better take care of such an emergency in future.  A plan that would enable either an RN on call or another staff member to remain with the patient until he is safely taken care of while the MRI machine and technician are freed up for the next waiting patient.
  
  Mine was the last appointment of the day so I was able to wait as I was going home.  If this had happened in the morning and I had to go back to my clinic I would have had to reschedule.
  
  Medical emergencies are not that infrequent and I believe we can be better prepared for them so they do no disrupt or interfere with the scheduled patient appointments regardless if they are physicians or busy moms or working dads.
  
  Again your staff was very courteous and professional and I know you will work on improving this patient experience for future patients.
  
  Thank you for your attention,
