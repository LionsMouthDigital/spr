comments: 'Hi - I received a text about a bill I had due from a DIFFERENT company than St. Paul Radiology and they wanted me to pay at a shady sounding website (ezmedinfo.com). You guys really need to do something so it appears that you are actually collecting the money, it is very shady and wasted a lot of my time today trying to determine if this was a scam or not. This reeks of scam. Please do something to to update this process to that it is evident that St. Paul Radiology is actually billing be and not some third party site in Russia.'
