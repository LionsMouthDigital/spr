	<hr>
	<li><strong>Ask for St. Paul Radiology by name</strong> - When outpatient diagnostic imaging is necessary you can choose your imaging provider. By choosing St. Paul Radiology for outpatient imaging it affects continuity of care when you become an inpatient at a Twin Cities East Metro hospital. Our hospital providers will have immediate access to your St. Paul Radiology outpatient imaging studies for efficient diagnosis outcomes.</li>
	<hr>
	<li><strong>Get a written order</strong> - Allow your primary care physician or ordering physician time to place the order with St. Paul Radiology. With few exceptions, such as a screening mammogram, all diagnostic imaging appointments must be accompanied by a referral from your physician. The information on this order allows St. Paul Radiology to accurately schedule your procedure or appointment.</li>

	<hr>
	<li><strong>Assemble your personal information</strong> - The scheduler may ask for your birth date, a contact number and may have further questions regarding your health and medical history. This information ensures your appointment is scheduled correctly.</li>
	<hr>
	<li><strong>Try to call from a private area that is noise free</strong> - By doing so both you and the scheduler will be able to verify information clearly and without interruption.</li>
	<hr>
	<li><strong>Know your insurance requirements</strong> - Will this diagnostic imaging require pre-authorization? St. Paul Radiology can assist in obtaining a prior authorization for select insurance plans, but not all plans.
