</p><h3>You deserve less. 33.8% less radiation dose.<br></h3><p>Recently we introduced Intego, an innovative new PET infusion system that reduces radiation dose by determining FDG amounts by patient weight. Our initial forecast was cautiously optimistic ─ 22.4% less radiation dose per patient. Now the results of our studies are in and Intego actually reduces radiation dose by up to 33.8%! It’s great news for patients ─ far less radiation dose with the same excellent care and image quality.</p>
