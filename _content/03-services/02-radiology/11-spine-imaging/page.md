      <h3>General Information About Spine Imaging
      </h3><p>Spine radiology focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the spine including cervical (neck), thoracic (between the neck and abdomen), and lumbar (lower spine). A spine radiologist provides imaging interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT), Ultrasound (US) and plain films (x-rays), and also performs some diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
      </p><p>The most common diagnostic examinations interpreted by the radiologist include Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), and plain films (x-rays). When necessary for diagnosis, a spine radiologist will inject dye into the spine (myelography) prior to a CT scan or disc (discography). A spine radiologist may help to treat pain referable to the spine with an injection. After interpreting an examination or performing an injection our radiologists communicate rapidly and effectively with your doctor.
      </p><p>All of St. Paul Radiologyâ€™s spine radiologists are board certified and have undergone fellowship training in interpreting medical images of the spine.

      	<li>Epidural steroid injections (transforaminal and midline)</li>
      	<li>Nerve root blocks (cervical, thoracic, intercostal and lumbar)</li>
      	<li>Sacroiliac joint injections</li>
