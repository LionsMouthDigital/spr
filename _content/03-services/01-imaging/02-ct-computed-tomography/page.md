      </p><p>Answer: Computed Tomography (CT) produces detailed images of the body, providing information about the internal organs, bones, and soft tissues and with computer generated assistance creates cross-sectional images of body tissues and organs that are used to diagnose diseases and disorders. Before your examination begins, a CT technologist will ask you a few medical questions, explain your procedure and assist you into the CT examination room. You will be asked to lie on a padded table, which will move into the scanner opening for the examination.
      </p><hr><p><em><strong>Question: What information should I provide before my CT examination?</strong></em>
