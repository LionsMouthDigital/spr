    section_content: '<h3>General Information About Breast Screening</h3><p>A screening mammography uses a low-dose x-ray system to examine soft tissue of the breasts. It is considered to be the best method available for the early detection of breast cancers because it can show changes in the breast up to two years before a patient or physician can feel them. The screening involves two X-rays of each breast. While it is generally a quick, painless procedure, the breasts are compressed during the examination to provide maximum image clarity and some patients do experience slight discomfort. A state-of-the-art Computer Aided Detection system aids the radiologist in identifying very subtle changes in the breast that may highlight areas of concern or the presence of cancer.<br></p>'
