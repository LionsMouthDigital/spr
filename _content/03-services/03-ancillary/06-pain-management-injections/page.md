    section_content: '<h3>Select Procedures</h3><hr><p><strong>Epidural Steroid Injection</strong></p><p>An epidural steroid injection (ESI) is a minimally invasive procedure that can help relieve neck, arm, back, and leg pain caused by inflamed spinal nerves. ESI may be performed to relieve pain caused by spinal stenosis, spondylolysis, or disc herniation. Medicines are delivered to the spinal nerve through the epidural space, the area between the protective covering of the spinal cord and vertebrae. Pain relief may last for several days or even years. The goal is to reduce pain so that you may resume normal activities.</p><hr><p><strong>Transforaminal Epidural Injection</strong></p><p>Like an epidural steroid injection a transforaminal injection is a minimally invasive procedure that can help relieve neck, arm, back, and leg pain caused by inflamed spinal nerves.  Transforaminal injections are performed for the same reasons as an ESI including pain relief pain caused by spinal stenosis, spondylolysis, or disc herniation. Medicines are delivered to the spinal nerve through what is normally a smaller needle, via a different approach to the area between the protective covering of the spinal cord and vertebrae. Pain relief may last for several days or even years. The goal is to reduce pain so that you may resume normal activities.<br></p>'
