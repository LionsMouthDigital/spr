</p><hr><p><strong>March 14, 2013</strong>
</p><blockquote>"I was seen at the Eagan facility. My technician Pat was terrific and is each year I see her. So friendly and professional. She makes the experience of getting a mammogram enjoyable!"</blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><hr><p><strong>February 16, 2013</strong>
</p><blockquote>"Woodbury/Lake Elmo. The procedure was quick and easy, without a long wait, and as I am from out of state and did not have my insurance card with me, the intake woman went the extra yard and called MAPS to get the information required. Thank you."</blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><hr><p><strong>January 22, 2013</strong>
</p><blockquote>"The MRI tech Dave was so patient, I am extremely claustrophobic and we just took our time. The schedulers Kathy and Anna were so accommodating with my hectic schedule."</blockquote><hr><p><strong>January 16, 2013</strong>
</p><blockquote>"I really liked how every step of the way I knew what the doctor was going to do and what might I expect."</blockquote><hr><p><strong>January 6, 2013</strong>
</p><blockquote>"Roseville - They were efficient, friendly, professional, and got me in with no waiting."</blockquote><hr><p><strong>December 15, 2012</strong>
</p><blockquote>"The woman conducting my Mammogram was as gentle and caring as can be. I've had her for the last three times and seeing her familiar and friendly face made the whole experience so much more comfortable."</blockquote><hr><p><strong>December 12, 2012</strong>
</p><blockquote>"I was seen at the Eagan facility. Debbie was my tech and she is wonderful! She is personable, compassionate & professional. I've been to your facility a dozen or so times & have had her several of my visits. She always remembers me & asks how I'm doing. I usually need IV contrast and am considered a difficult stick. She is one of the few who is able to start the IV on the first try. She is an asset to St. Paul Radiology."</blockquote><hr><p><strong>December 12, 2012</strong>
</p><blockquote>"Eagan Center. Mona was great, the best technician I have had in almost 20 years of mammograms. There was far less pain involved with her in charge!"</blockquote><hr><p><strong>December 11, 2012</strong>
</p><blockquote>"Felt very comfortable for the needle injections which didn't even hurt me & such nice nurses & Dr. Goertzen was very nice & I trusted in him!"</blockquote><hr><p><strong>December 9, 2012</strong>

</p><blockquote>"I was especially impressed with Joyce the nurse. She has a warm and professional mannerism, which created a relaxed atmosphere for me."</blockquote><hr><p><strong>November 9, 2012</strong>
</p><blockquote>"My radiologist was friendly, caring, professional and very helpful, while doing the ultrasound. From my knee down, my leg was extremely sore. She did a great job of not hurting me. I had a choice of where to have the ultrasound done and I specifically asked to go to St Paul Radiology."</blockquote>
