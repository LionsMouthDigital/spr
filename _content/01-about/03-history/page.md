<h3>A Brief History</h3>
<p>The medical specialty of radiology and St. Paul Radiology both have rich histories. The current physicians of St. Paul Radiology would like to thank their predecessors for their council, training and leadership. Much of the content for the history of St. Paul Radiology comes from John B. Coleman, M.D. who wrote the first account of the history of this practice and published this for his colleagues in May of 1999.
</p>
<p>His Author's Note: "These are sketches of the first 13 members of St. Paul Radiology who comprise three "generations" of the findings of this independent professional group. Older members will reminisce with me; the younger may find some surprising notes in the history of the organization which gives them their identity. I am responsible for what is said. I interviewed all living principles and widows."<br>
