<h4>Madison and Tashjian Named Among Minnesota Monthly’s 2014 Best Doctors for Women</h4><p>The physicians of St. Paul Radiology congratulate their colleagues, Michael T. Madison, M.D. and Joseph H. Tashjian, M.D., who were named among Minnesota Monthly's 2014 Best Doctors for Women by their peers. It's physicians like these who are a big reason why generations of patients have trusted St. Paul Radiology for comprehensive imaging and radiology services. Their high standard of excellence and commitment to responsible imaging are reflective of our approach to patient care at St. Paul Radiology. A place where careful evaluations from our highly trained specialists result in faster interpretations that are right the first time. That means lower costs and better outcomes.
