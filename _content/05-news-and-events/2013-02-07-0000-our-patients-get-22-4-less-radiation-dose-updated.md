<h4>Our Patients Deserve Less – 22.4% Less Radiation Dose</h4><p><strong>Update: <a href="http://www.stpaulradiology.com/news-and-events/our-patients-get-33-8-percent-less-radiation-dose" target="_blank">Our Patients Get Less Than We Thought!</a></strong></p><p>As part of St. Paul Radiology's commitment to minimize radiation exposure, our downtown location now has the innovative <a href="http://www.medrad.com/en-us/info/products/Pages/Intego.aspx" target="_blank">Medrad Intego™ PET Infusion System</a>, the first in St. Paul. The Intego controls radiation dose via weight-based calculation of the exact amount of FDG needed for each patient. This limits the amount of radiation to only what is needed for an accurate diagnosis. The system decreases radiation exposure by 22.4% with no decrease in image quality. Both patients and technologists enjoy smarter, safer, simpler PET.</p>
