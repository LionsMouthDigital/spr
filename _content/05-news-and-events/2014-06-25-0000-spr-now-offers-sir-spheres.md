<h4>Treatment Extends Survival Time to Patients with Metastatic Liver Tumors<br></h4><p>St. Paul Radiology is pleased to announce the availability of SIR-Spheres Microspheres<sup>1</sup> at Regions Hospital. Manufactured by Sirtex for patients with metastatic liver cancer, SIR-Spheres microspheres are the only fully FDA-approved microspheres for colorectal cancer that has metastasized to the liver.
</p><p>At least 60 percent<sup>2</sup> of the nearly 150,000 Americans diagnosed with colorectal cancer every year will see their cancer spread to the liver, and most liver tumors cannot be surgically resected. Metastatic liver cancer is often fatal, with up to 90 percent of patients dying from liver failure. Microspheres therapy has emerged as a treatment option for patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver.

</p><h4>SIR-Spheres Selectively Target Liver Tumors With Precision<br></h4><p>SIR-Spheres microspheres are microscopic radioactive spheres that can be delivered by the millions directly to the tumor site. The microspheres contain the radioactive isotope yttrium-90, which delivers beta radiation to the tumor. The microspheres selectively target liver tumors with a dose of internal radiation up to 40 times higher than conventional radiotherapy while sparing healthy tissue.
</p><p>SIR-Spheres microspheres are a powerful weapon against one of the deadliest forms of cancer. In the past, we were able to offer patients few, if any, targeted treatment options. SIR-Spheres microspheres have been proven to extend patient survival and, just as importantly, the treatment allows patients to maintain a good quality of life.
</p><p>SIR-Spheres microspheres are indicated for treatment of unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver. Ongoing research and peer reviewed published papers in the literature suggest that yttrium-90 microspheres may also be effective in treating other forms of liver tumors. These include tumors from hepatocellular carcinoma as well as liver metastases from other primary sources. Treatment for these tumor types is investigational and is not approved under the current SIR-Spheres microspheres FDA approval.<br>
