<h4>Our Patients Deserve Less – 33.8% Less Radiation Dose<br></h4><p>Recently we introduced Intego, an innovative new <a href="http://www.medrad.com/en-us/info/products/Pages/Intego.aspx" target="_blank">PET Infusion System</a> that reduces radiation dose by determining FDG amounts by patient weight. Our initial forecast was cautiously optimistic – 22.4% less radiation dose per patient. Now the results of our studies are in and Intego actually reduces radiation dose by up to 33.8%! It’s great news for patients - far less radiation dose with the same excellent care and image quality.</p>
